## Data mining the NZ housing market

Choosing a house in NZ is hard. This project pulls together publicly available price, school, geographical, demographic, and other info for as many properties as possible, using public apis and hand entry. 

automated sources include [Stats NZ](http://stats.govt.nz), [Trademe](http://trademe.co.nz) and [Koordinates](http://koordinates.com).

The project currently uses sqlite as a database, python for api interaction, and a mix of python and R for data analysis.

### TODO

- Solr search engine
- mail merge on real estate agent's email for price info
- building price models 
- possibly add Zenbu business and POI information
