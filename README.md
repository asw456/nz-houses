## Data mining the NZ housing market

This project is primarily for data collection and analysis for New Zealand Residential and Rental Listings from the [Trademe](http://trademe.co.nz) API. In addition there are less fully featured clients for other publicly available price, school, geographical, and demographic data including [Koordinates](http://koordinates.com) and [Stats NZ](http://stats.govt.nz).

Residential and Rental listings are retrieved in JSON form, parsed and inserted into an SQLite database for query or analysis. There are some R scripts for analysis and a comprehensive mortgage simulator with interest rate and capital gain modelling is coming soon.

### Other todos

- build price models for inferring unlisted prices

- mail merge on real estate agent's email (heh heh)
