## NZ housing market data mining

This project is for collecting real estate and financial data, building price and investment models, and using this to inform a house purchase. 

Data is collected from [Trademe](http://trademe.co.nz) which captures the majority of the market. Additional data such as school zone, geographical info, and demographic data is collected from [Koordinates](http://koordinates.com) and [Stats NZ](http://stats.govt.nz).

### Current status

- Trademe and Koordinates clients and database completed. Stats NZ client nearly ready.

- MC mortgage simulator finished.

- Feature extraction and price modelling in progress.
